Strengths of github: 1. You can track your progress over time, and recover lost files if needed
                     2. Great for group projects / collaborations, since everyone can track everyone's progress
Weaknesses of github: 1. It can be hard and confusing to use at first
                      2. It cannot handle larger files or data
